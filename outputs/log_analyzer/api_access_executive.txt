Our systems experienced a critical issue where customers could not complete payments, and our internal dashboards and reports were temporarily unavailable. This directly impacted our revenue as customer transactions failed and affected our internal teams' ability to monitor operations. Our engineering team is actively investigating and resolving the payment system and internal service outages. We are also enhancing our monitoring and security measures to prevent future occurrences. We expect the critical payment and internal service issues to be resolved within the next hour, with full preventative measures implemented over the next 24-48 hours.
