We experienced several issues with our database that caused delays and errors for users.
Some transactions failed due to conflicts, and many users were unable to connect to the system because we reached our connection limit.
We are optimizing our database queries and increasing the connection capacity to resolve these issues.
We expect to have everything fixed within the next few hours.
